This repository will include content created for the course **Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science**, offered through UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs during the 2025 winter quarter.

# <ins>Course Description</ins>
**Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science** prepares students to acquire, explore, model, and communicate with data through research and visuzliation.  Through course assignments and projects, students will develop analytical methods to address urban problems through an equity lens.

Students will learn to do this through:
- Demonstrating the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critically evaluating data and creating frameworks to prepare data for research
- Applying data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Learning to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Learning to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
