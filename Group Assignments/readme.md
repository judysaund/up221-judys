# **Project Proposal: Beyond Demolition - Examining RSO Loss and Replacement in Los Angeles**

## **Individual Project**
This project will be completed individually by **Judy Saunders**.

## **Research Question**
How has the demolition of Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) units in Los Angeles evolved over time, and what role have market-rate and affordable housing developments played in replacing these units? How have policies like ED1 and TOC influenced these trends?

## **Introduction**
The evolution of RSO demolitions and subsequent replacement developments in Los Angeles raises critical questions about housing equity and policy efficacy. This project seeks to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of RSO demolitions, the role for-profit and nonprofit developers play in these demolitions, and how policies incentivizing development impact the displacement of RSO tenants. The research will explore these dynamics with a focus on what equity means within affordable housing development.

## **Significance**
This research is vital given Los Angeles' ongoing housing crisis, where rising rents and housing shortages disproportionately affect low-income renters and communities of color. Understanding how RSO demolitions align with urban development trends, and the contributions of different types of developers, can inform policies to better balance development pressures with tenant protections. Additionally, the analysis will determine whether there has been a net positive in affordable units and quantify how many units have been added to Los Angeles as a result of RSO demolitions. Policymakers, developers, and community advocates can use this analysis to shape strategies for inclusive and sustainable housing development.

## **Spatial and Temporal Scope**
- **Spatial Scope**: The City of Los Angeles, focusing on neighborhoods with high rates of RSO demolitions and redevelopment.
- **Temporal Scope**: Analysis will cover data from 2007 to 2024, with an emphasis on identifying trends over time and evaluating recent impacts of ED1 and TOC policies.

## **Scope and Intended Analysis**
1. **Analyze Demolition Patterns**: Identify trends in RSO demolitions over time, examining which neighborhoods and Council Districts are most affected.
2. **Evaluate Development Characteristics**: Assess the change in housing stock, both market rate and affordable. Analyze whether there has been a net positive in affordable housing units as a result of RSO demolitions and calculate the total number of new units added to Los Angeles.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Map demolition and replacement sites to evaluate their spatial distribution and relationship to Council Districts.

## **Conclusion**
This project will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of RSO demolitions, the role of developers, and the net impact on affordable housing in Los Angeles. By identifying disparities and gaps in housing replacement strategies and assessing policy-driven housing outcomes, the research aims to inform recommendations that promote sustainable and inclusive urban development.
